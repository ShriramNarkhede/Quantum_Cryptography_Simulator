## ⚙️ Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Quantum Key Distribution (BB84)
- Alice and Bob exchange qubits with random bases
- Matching bases produce identical bits → **Quantum Key (Kqkd)**
- Eavesdropping detection via Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER)

### 2️⃣ Post-Quantum Key Exchange (Kyber)
- Kyber generates a **shared classical key (Kpqc)** using lattice-based cryptography
- Resistant to quantum attacks

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Key Creation
The final **Initial Key Material (IKM)** is:
```
IKM = Kqkd || Kpqc
```

### 4️⃣ HKDF Derivation
The hybrid key is passed through **HKDF (HMAC-SHA256)** with session ID as salt:
```
key_stream_seed = HKDF-Expand(PRK, "otp-stream")
key_mac = HKDF-Expand(PRK, "hmac-key")
key_file = HKDF-Expand(PRK, "file-key")
```

### 5️⃣ Secure Message Exchange

**Encryption:**
- Derive a unique key stream segment per message:
  ```
  key_stream = HKDF-Expand(key_stream_seed, "msg-<seq>-<session>")
  ciphertext = plaintext XOR key_stream
  ```
- Compute integrity tag:
  ```
  tag = HMAC_SHA3_256(key_mac, AAD || ciphertext)
  ```
- Send `{ciphertext, tag, seq_no, timestamp, session_id}`

**Decryption:**
- Verify tag → regenerate same key stream → XOR decrypt

✅ **Provides confidentiality + integrity**

### 6️⃣ Secure File Exchange
Uses **XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD**:
- Random 24-byte `nonce`
- AAD includes `session_id + file_seq + filename`
- Encrypts file content + generates authentication tag

**Encryption:**
```
ciphertext, tag = XChaCha20_Encrypt(key_file, nonce, AAD, file_bytes)
```

**Decryption:**
```
plaintext = XChaCha20_Decrypt(key_file, nonce, AAD, ciphertext, tag)
```

✅ **Ensures confidentiality, authenticity, and replay protection**

### 7️⃣ Session Management
- Session created between Alice and Bob → `session_id = S-12345`
- On high QBER or logout, all keys are **securely deleted**
- Session state and history are cleared for privacy

## 🧠 Example Flow

**Session:** `S-67890`  
**Message:** `"Hello Bob"`  
**File:** `report.pdf`

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Run BB84 | Kqkd = `101101...` |
| 2 | Run Kyber | Kpqc = `a4c1e29f...` |

## 🔐 Quantum Security FAQ

### 1. Is Our Project Quantum Attack Safe?

**Yes, our project is designed to be quantum attack safe** through a hybrid approach combining two quantum-resistant technologies:

#### ✅ **BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**
- **Information-theoretic security**: BB84's security is based on fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, not computational assumptions
- **Eavesdropping detection**: Any attempt to intercept or measure quantum states introduces detectable errors (QBER)
- **No mathematical vulnerability**: Unlike classical cryptography, BB84 cannot be broken by faster computers (classical or quantum) because its security relies on the **no-cloning theorem** and **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**
- **Future-proof**: Even with unlimited computational power, an attacker cannot clone quantum states or measure them without detection

#### ✅ **CRYSTALS-Kyber Post-Quantum Cryptography**
- **Lattice-based security**: Kyber is based on the hardness of lattice problems (Learning With Errors - LWE)
- **NIST-approved**: Selected as a standard by NIST in 2022 for post-quantum key encapsulation
- **Quantum-resistant**: No known quantum algorithm (including Shor's) can efficiently solve lattice problems
- **Hybrid redundancy**: Even if one component were compromised, the other provides security

#### 🔒 **Hybrid Security Model**
Our system combines both approaches:
```
Final Key = BB84 Quantum Key || Kyber Post-Quantum Key
```
This **dual-layer protection** ensures that:
- If quantum computers break classical cryptography, BB84 still provides security
- If QKD faces implementation challenges, Kyber provides post-quantum security
- Both must be compromised simultaneously for a complete breach

### 2. How Is It Different From Traditional Cryptography (RSA, DES, AES)?

Our quantum-safe system fundamentally differs from traditional cryptography in multiple ways:

| Aspect | Traditional Cryptography (RSA, DES, AES) | Our Quantum-Safe System |
|--------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Security Foundation** | Computational complexity (assumes problems are hard to solve) | Quantum mechanics + Lattice problems (proven mathematically hard) |
| **Key Exchange** | RSA/ECDH (vulnerable to Shor's algorithm) | BB84 QKD + Kyber (quantum-resistant) |
| **Attack Model** | Assumes attacker has limited computational power | Assumes attacker may have quantum computers |
| **Eavesdropping Detection** | ❌ No built-in detection | ✅ QBER monitoring detects interception |
| **Forward Security** | Optional (depends on implementation) | ✅ Built-in (each session generates new keys) |
| **Information Theoretic Security** | ❌ No (computational security only) | ✅ Yes (BB84 provides unconditional security) |
| **Future-Proof** | ❌ Vulnerable to quantum computers | ✅ Resistant to both classical and quantum attacks |

#### **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**
- **How it works**: Based on the difficulty of factoring large integers
- **Vulnerability**: Shor's algorithm can factor integers in polynomial time on quantum computers
- **Our approach**: We don't use RSA; instead, we use BB84 (quantum mechanics) and Kyber (lattice problems)

#### **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
- **How it works**: Symmetric key block cipher (56-bit keys)
- **Vulnerability**: Broken by brute force attacks; vulnerable to quantum Grover's algorithm (reduces security by half)
- **Our approach**: We use XChaCha20-Poly1305 (256-bit keys) which, even with Grover's algorithm, maintains 128-bit security (still secure)

#### **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
- **How it works**: Symmetric key block cipher (128/192/256-bit keys)
- **Vulnerability**: Key exchange (RSA/ECDH) is vulnerable; AES itself is quantum-resistant with sufficient key size
- **Our approach**: We use quantum-safe key exchange (BB84 + Kyber) combined with XChaCha20-Poly1305, providing end-to-end quantum resistance

#### **Key Differences Summary**:

1. **Key Exchange Mechanism**:
   - **Traditional**: RSA/ECDH (mathematical problems vulnerable to quantum computers)
   - **Ours**: BB84 (quantum mechanics) + Kyber (lattice problems)

2. **Security Proof**:
   - **Traditional**: Computational security (assumes attacker can't solve hard problems)
   - **Ours**: Information-theoretic security (BB84) + proven mathematical hardness (Kyber)

3. **Eavesdropping Detection**:
   - **Traditional**: No way to detect passive interception
   - **Ours**: QBER monitoring automatically detects any interception attempts

4. **Future-Proofing**:
   - **Traditional**: Will be broken when quantum computers mature
   - **Ours**: Designed to remain secure even with quantum computers

### 3. How Does Shor's Algorithm Break Traditional Systems, and Why Is Our System Safe?

#### 🔓 **How Shor's Algorithm Breaks Traditional Cryptography**

**Shor's Algorithm** (developed by Peter Shor in 1994) is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently solve two mathematical problems that form the foundation of most modern cryptography:

1. **Integer Factorization** (breaks RSA)
2. **Discrete Logarithm Problem** (breaks ECDH, DSA, ECDSA)

##### **Breaking RSA with Shor's Algorithm**:

**Traditional RSA Security**:
- RSA relies on the fact that factoring large numbers (e.g., 2048-bit) is computationally infeasible
- Best classical algorithm: General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) - exponential time complexity
- For a 2048-bit RSA key: Classical computer would need ~10^20 years to break

**Shor's Algorithm Attack**:
- **Time complexity**: O((log N)³) - polynomial time!
- For a 2048-bit RSA key: Quantum computer could break it in minutes/hours
- **How it works**:
  1. Uses quantum superposition to test all possible factors simultaneously
  2. Quantum Fourier Transform finds the period of a function
  3. Period reveals the factors of the number
  4. Once factors are known, private key is compromised

**Example**:
```
RSA-2048 Key → Shor's Algorithm → Factors found → Private key extracted → All encrypted data compromised
```

##### **Breaking ECDH/ECDSA with Shor's Algorithm**:

**Traditional ECDH Security**:
- Based on Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)
- Best classical algorithm: Pollard's rho - exponential time
- 256-bit ECC key ≈ 3072-bit RSA security classically

**Shor's Algorithm Attack**:
- Solves discrete logarithm on elliptic curves in polynomial time
- 256-bit ECC key broken as easily as RSA-2048
- All ECDH key exchanges become insecure

#### ✅ **Why Our System Is Safe From Shor's Algorithm**

Our system is **immune to Shor's algorithm** because we don't rely on the problems it can solve:

##### **1. BB84 Quantum Key Distribution**

**Why Shor's can't break BB84**:
- **No mathematical problem to solve**: BB84 doesn't use factorization or discrete logarithms
- **Security from physics**: Based on quantum mechanical principles:
  - **No-cloning theorem**: Quantum states cannot be perfectly copied
  - **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**: Measuring a quantum state disturbs it
  - **Information-theoretic security**: Security doesn't depend on computational assumptions
- **Eavesdropping detection**: Any measurement attempt introduces errors (QBER > threshold)
- **Shor's algorithm is irrelevant**: There's no mathematical problem for Shor's to solve

**BB84 Security Model**:
```
Eve tries to intercept → Must measure qubits → Disturbs quantum states → 
QBER increases → Alice & Bob detect → Abort session → Key remains secret
```

##### **2. CRYSTALS-Kyber (Lattice-Based Cryptography)**

**Why Shor's can't break Kyber**:
- **Different mathematical problem**: Kyber is based on **Learning With Errors (LWE)** over lattices
- **No known quantum speedup**: Lattice problems are believed to be hard even for quantum computers
- **Quantum resistance**: Even with quantum computers, best known algorithms are still exponential
- **NIST validation**: Selected specifically because it resists both classical and quantum attacks

**Kyber Security Model**:
```
Lattice Problem (LWE) → No efficient quantum algorithm exists → 
Even quantum computers need exponential time → Secure against Shor's
```

##### **3. Hybrid Protection**

Our system uses **both** BB84 and Kyber, providing redundancy:

```
Attack Scenario Analysis:

1. Quantum computer with Shor's algorithm attacks:
   ❌ Can't break BB84 (no math problem to solve)
   ❌ Can't break Kyber (different problem, no quantum speedup)
   ✅ System remains secure

2. If BB84 implementation has issues:
   ✅ Kyber still provides post-quantum security

3. If Kyber has future vulnerabilities:
   ✅ BB84 still provides information-theoretic security

4. Both must fail simultaneously for breach:
   ✅ Extremely unlikely - different security foundations
```

#### 📊 **Security Comparison Table**

| System | Shor's Algorithm Impact | Security Status |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **RSA-2048** | ✅ Broken in polynomial time | ❌ Insecure with quantum computers |
| **ECDH-256** | ✅ Broken in polynomial time | ❌ Insecure with quantum computers |
| **AES-256** | ⚠️ Key exchange broken (RSA/ECDH) | ⚠️ Vulnerable if key exchange compromised |
| **BB84 QKD** | ✅ No impact (no math problem) | ✅ Secure (information-theoretic) |
| **CRYSTALS-Kyber** | ✅ No impact (different problem) | ✅ Secure (quantum-resistant) |
| **Our Hybrid System** | ✅ No impact (uses BB84 + Kyber) | ✅ Secure (dual-layer protection) |

#### 🎯 **Conclusion**

**Traditional systems (RSA, ECDH)**:
- Rely on problems (factoring, discrete log) that Shor's algorithm solves efficiently
- Will be completely broken when large-scale quantum computers arrive
- Currently secure only because quantum computers aren't powerful enough yet

**Our quantum-safe system**:
- Uses BB84 (quantum mechanics) and Kyber (lattice problems)
- Neither component relies on problems that Shor's algorithm can solve
- Remains secure even with powerful quantum computers
- Provides **future-proof security** for the quantum computing era
